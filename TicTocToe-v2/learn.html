              Mar 29, 2019 - Part 1. Playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Draw the board. First,
              you have to draw the board, which is made up of a 3 x 3 grid of
              squares. Have the first player go first. Have the second player go
              second. Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn
              a row of three symbols or until no one can win. Keep practicing.

            <p class="About">
              The first player, who shall be designated "X", has 3 possible
              positions to mark during the first turn. Superficially, it might
              seem that there are 9 possible positions, corresponding to the 9
              squares in the grid. However, by rotating the board, we will find
              that in the first turn, every corner mark is strategically
              equivalent to every other corner mark..
